# Implement-relational-model-

In the my Java project, I implement a minimal relational model emulator
using Java programming language that can provide basic relational model and algebra
functionalities in-memory. This means that your emulator will perform the operations in the run
time and do not have to actually store the data . A successfully implemented emulator will be
1
able to create relational model elements such as relations, tuples, and attributes, check the
validity/constraints of the relation descriptions and relation instances, enforce those
constraints, enable data modification and certain retrieval operations outlined below.
